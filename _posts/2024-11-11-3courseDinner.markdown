It is easy to get stuck in a box of making the same recipes repeatedly and rarely deviating from them. This allows one to get very proficient at those select dishes and is a great idea to have a few simple, healthy recipes that you can return to. Straying away from those simple dishes allows you to feel more creativity and have some trial and error to hopefully produce a tasty dish. Doing this 3 course meal allowed me to try a couple of different techniques including making pasta, deep frying and some practice with icing a birthday cake for Lauren.

Below are the dishes that I made along with some pictures of the food.
## Starter

# Arancini, filled with mozzarella

These turned out pretty well and got more round as I was making them.

# Spinach and mushroom ravioli
I have made fresh pasta a few times now and I am beginning to get the hang of it. The ravioli did not turn out perfectly however. I think this was in part due to having a slightly too wet filling which made the pasta sheet on the bottom difficult to pry from the worksurface before putting in the boiling water. I also should have wetted the edges of the pasta to create a better seal.

All in all they turned out a little more like dumplings but they still tasted pretty good. I could also definitely use a bit more care when plating to try and create food that also looks good as we often are said to "eat with your eyes" and the dish below looks a little on the rustic side...

# Chocolate orange birthday cake

Cake was incredibly moist and I added orange extract to the buttercream to emulate a Terrys chocolate orange as it is one of Lauren's favourites.

All in all a very nice meal, although cooking from scratch and cleaning up can be a lot of work following Mise en Place can make such a big difference. It also helps the chef focus on the flavours and become more immeresed in the process instead of constantly being frantic to ensure everything comes together at once. The same can be said for prepping everything that can be prepped in advance.
